          Welcome to Mission Mars, a cause dedicated to the future of humanity -
          colonizing the Red Planet. Our mission is to raise awareness and
          support for the scientific, technological, and human challenges and
          possibilities that Mars colonization presents.

        <div className={style.sectionTitle}>Why Mars?</div>
        <div className={style.sectionContent}>
          Why should we colonize Mars? The answer lies in our innate human
          desire to explore, to push boundaries, and to ensure the survival of
          our species. Mars, with its similarities to Earth and its potential
          for habitation, presents a unique opportunity. Colonizing Mars could
          lead to breakthroughs in technology and science, potentially even
          answering the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe?

        <div className={style.sectionTitle}>The Plan</div>
        <div className={style.sectionContent}>
          Our plan for colonizing Mars is ambitious yet achievable. It begins
          with unmanned missions to study the planet in detail. Next, we aim to
          establish a base for robots and, eventually, humans. Overcoming
          challenges such as radiation, low gravity, and limited resources will
          require innovation and determination. But we believe in the power of
          human ingenuity to rise to these challenges.
